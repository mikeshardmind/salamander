This is a bit sparse right now and more detail will be added to this later. The following guidelines apply to contributions.


1. All contributions, code or otherwise, should follow the project code of conduct.
2. All code contributions from non-members should be discussed in advance. Please do not open a pull request without having done this.
3. Python source files should be formatted with [black](https://github.com/psf/black) and with [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort), using the compatible profile.
4. Pull requests should have a limited scope to what they intend to accomplish.
5. Commit messages should be meaningful.
